# Shock at St. Peter’s: The World Says Goodbye to Pope Francis

In a poignant and somber atmosphere, thousands of mourners filed through St. Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday, marking the start of an emotional three-day public viewing for Pope Francis. The air was thick with reverence as ordinary faithful and dignitaries alike took their time paying respects to the beloved pontiff.

## A Lasting Legacy at St. Peter’s

At the heart of the basilica, Francis' simple open wooden casket sat elevated on a slight ramp, surrounded by the vigilant presence of four Swiss Guards. The 16th-century architectural marvel became a sanctuary for grief, as tens of thousands are expected to pass through its hallowed hallways over the coming days. The Vatican has even stated it may keep the basilica open past midnight due to the overwhelming turnout.

As the world reflects on the legacy of Pope Francis, the palpable love and respect in the room is evident. This farewell is not just a moment of loss, but a celebration of a life dedicated to compassion and connection.

In the end, amidst the sorrow, we find hope and unity in our shared humanity. The memory of Pope Francis will live on, reminding us of the power of love and the importance of coming together.
