# On Easter Sunday, Congregants at This 216-Year-Old Harlem Church Channeled Southern Baptist Style

Beyond the Easter egg hunts, the baskets stuffed with shredded tissue paper, and the sugar highs from too much candy, church is at the heart of many early-morning Easter rituals. *On Easter Sunday*, congregants at the historic **Abyssinian Baptist Church**—a Gothic architectural gem in Harlem—don vibrant outfits, merging tradition with modern flair.

## The Heart of Easter Fashion

For many in the Baptist denomination, Easter Sunday church service isn’t just a religious obligation but a homecoming. It becomes a community celebration, a gathering to honor Christ’s resurrection. People arrive dressed in fresh, spring-inspired looks, often wearing something new to mark rebirth and reverence. The church swells with a shared spirit, and by the service’s end, as the congregants overflow into the streets, so does the fashion.

Distinctly Southern-rooted styles shine through—wide-brimmed hats adorned with tulle, pastel suits, floral dresses, and those ever-present frilly white socks on children. It’s more than just clothing; it’s a ritual imbued with heritage and collective memory.

“A tradition to get new suits, usually bright colors, brings back memories of our heritage,” one patron stated. The ensemble expresses not only individual style but also communal identity, uniting families in celebration.

## Embracing Tradition in Fashion

**Easter** at Abyssinian is a canvas of colors, textures, and stories. From tailored suits to carefully selected accessories, each outfit reflects family traditions and personal inspirations. Some patrons shared how their looks were influenced by current fashion events, while others leaned into heritage.

As the people pour into the church, their attire encapsulates the spirit of Easter—joyful, colorful, and deeply rooted in tradition. “You’re supposed to wear something gifted on Easter,” stated one individual, highlighting the significance of shared memories in their choices.

## A Celebration of Community and Style

Amidst the historical significance of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, the fashion displayed serves as a testament to the resilience and creativity of the community. Many expressed how dressing up for Easter is about identity and pride, an opportunity to showcase the intersection of personal style and cultural heritage.

Joycelyn McGeachy-Kuls encapsulated this sentiment perfectly, stating, “What’s happening in church fashion right now is people are leaning into their culture and finding strength in it. We want to lift our community up, and dressing up is a big part of that.”

Easter at the Abyssinian Baptist Church is both a moment of celebration and reflection, where fashion becomes a vessel for identity, community, and heritage. While the styles may evolve, the spirit remains timeless, bringing together generations in a vibrant tapestry of colors and stories.

Let's embrace these moments of cultural heritage, honoring the past while stepping boldly into the future. Each Easter outfit, a narrative woven through fabric, reminds us that **fashion is not just what we wear** but a reflection of who we are and where we come from.
