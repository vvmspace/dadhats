# Summer Is Coming—Get Your Lid Inspiration from Central Park’s Hat Party

Nothing says spring in New York like a fabulous hat—and nowhere are they on more glorious display than at the Frederick Law Olmsted Awards Luncheon, affectionately known as the “Central Park Hat Party.” This event transformed the Conservatory Garden into a runway of creativity and color, inspiring your summer style.

## Central Park Hat Party: A Celebration of Style

From sculptural fascinators to wide-brimmed classics decked in silk blooms, the hats at this invitation-only event were as bold and beautiful as the cause. As the guests sipped champagne and admired each other’s headwear, they also helped raise over $4 million for the care and restoration of Central Park. 

This is not just an ordinary gathering; it’s the city’s most elegant outdoor fundraiser that seamlessly combines fashion, philanthropy, and civic pride. The Women's Committee, a 1,000-member strong organization, has raised over $200 million since its founding in 1983. 

## Get Inspired

As summer approaches, let this iconic garden party be your guide to seasonal style. Whether you’re donning feathers, flowers, or embracing "dad hats" for a laid-back yet stylish look, there’s no better place to find inspiration than New York’s most sophisticated celebration for a cause. 

As you soak up the sun, remember: the best fashion statements are the ones that give back. So go ahead, explore your style and perhaps sport a "dad hat" with pride. You might just make a statement that lasts beyond the summer.
